# Email-bot
An application dealing with my emails(which are often 3000+, too many for me to look through).

I had this idea today because I suddenly realized there are just too many emails from different sources and I am only interested in a certain amount of them.

I subscribed to a lot of information sources(nyt, wsj, deeplearningai etc.) so I will have to separate them from my school and work emails. In the meantime I do want to take a look of some of them with topics I am interested in. 

TODO:

-- The initial idea is to create a structured list every day summarising the key words in those emails so I could have a clearer preview for how many I will be interested in and what those emails are about.

-- I also want to apply some machine learning techniques in this so the strutured lists could be a little more customized based on my own preferences.

-- Maybe a to-read list and checklist will work better for me on the client side.
